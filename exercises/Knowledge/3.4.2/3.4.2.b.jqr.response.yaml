    Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree
    data structure. The algorithm starts at the bottom left leaf node of a tree
    and goes as far as it can up its given branch (path), then backtracks until
    it finds an unexplored path, and then explores it.

    - O(|V|+|E|)
    - O(|V|+2|E|)
    - O(2(|V|+|E|))
