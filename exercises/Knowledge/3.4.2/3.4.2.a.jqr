  text: Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data
    structure. The algorithm starts at the root (top) node of a tree and goes as far
    as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks until it finds an unexplored
    path, and then explores it.

  text: Given a binary tree where the following items are inserted from left to right&#58;
    [5,3,1,4,2], what order will DFS traverse the nodes assuming preorder traversal
    and assuming smaller items go to the left node and larger items to the right?
