    Assuming the previously explored node is n1, Dijkstra's algorithm determines
    the next node, n2, to explore according to what criteria (mark all that
    apply)?
  choices:
    - n2 has not been visited
    - n2 is a neighbor to n1
    - Edge (n1,n2) is the lowest weight amongst neighbors to n1
    - n2 has shortest path to source node s
