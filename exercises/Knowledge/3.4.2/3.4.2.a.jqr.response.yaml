    Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data
    structure. The algorithm starts at the root (top) node of a tree and goes as
    far as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks until it finds an
    unexplored path, and then explores it.

    Assuming an adjacency list graph representation and given that V represents
    the set of vertices and E represents the set of edges, what is the time
    complexity of a DFS search of a connected graph
  choices:
    - O(|V||E|)
    - O(|V|+|E|)
    - O(|V|+2|E|)
    - O(2(|V|+|E|))

    Given a binary tree where the following items are inserted from left to
    right: [5,3,1,4,2], what order will DFS traverse the nodes assuming preorder
    traversal and assuming smaller items go to the left node and larger items to
    the right?
