    The strncpy() function requires an argument of the length of string to copy
    so it will copy only up to that amount of characters to ensure a buffer
    overrun doesn't occur. If it doesn't encounter the end of the string within
    the specified length, then the final character is replaced with a NULL byte.

    - scanf("%s", input);
    - scanf("%19s", input);
