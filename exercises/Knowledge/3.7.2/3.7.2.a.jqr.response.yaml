      They can be used to determine if there are IP duplicate IP addresses
      outside the local network.
    - >-
      They are useful in redundancy situations. A hosts ARP cache can be updated
      by a gratuitous ARP so that hosts can send frames are sent to the failover
      device.
    - They can be used to immediately update the CAM table of a layer 2 swtich.

      They can be used to immediately update the ARP cache of devices on the
      local network.
