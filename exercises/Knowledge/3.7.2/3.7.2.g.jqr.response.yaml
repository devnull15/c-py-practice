  choices:
    - This packet can propagate to only one more router before it is dropped.
    - This packet is carrying a TCP segment that is using tcpmux.
    - This packet is carrying ICMP data/information.

    An IPv4 packet makes it to a router. The router looks up the destination
    network, and finds a matching route? What items in the packet will be
    changed before it routed?
  choices:
    - The source IP address will the changed to that of said router.
    - >-
      If the exit interface is Ethernet, the source MAC address will be changed
      to that of said router.
    - >-
      If the exit interface is Ethernet, the destination MAC address will be
      changed to that of the next router or host.
    - The Time to Live (TTL) will typically be decremented by one.
    - The header checksum will be recalculated.
    - The identification field will be replaced by the said router ID.
    - >-
      The "More Fragments" flag will be set to 1 to indicate that this is one of
      many packets.

  text: Which of the following are some rules of fragmentation?
  choices:
    - The first fragment will have an fragment offset of 0.
    - >-
      The first fragment will have an fragment offset of 20 as the IP header is
      20 bytes and the data portion starts immediately after the header.
    - The first fragment will have the Don't Fragment (DF) flag set.
    - The first fragment will have the More Fragments (MF) flag set.
    - The first fragment will have no flags set.
    - All but the first fragment will have a non-zero fragment offset.
    - >-
      All fragments in the fragment train will have a non-zero fragment offset
      indicating that they are part of a fragment.
    - The last fragment will have the Don't Fragment (DF) flag set.
    - The last fragment will have the More Fragment (MF) flag set.
    - The last fragment will have no flags set.
    - >-
      The last fragment will have an offset of zero indicating it is the last
      fragment.
    - The last fragment will have an non-zero fragment offset
    - >-
      The IP ID will increment so that the destination system will know how to
      reorder the fragments.
    - >-
      The IP ID of all fragments will be the same so the destination system
      knows which fragments are related.
    - >-
      The IP ID of all fragments will be set to zero indicating they are not
      typical packets.
