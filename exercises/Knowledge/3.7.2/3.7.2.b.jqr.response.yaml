    What can be done in order for HTTP/HTTPS to maintain a "stateful"
    connection?
  choices:
    - By holding the TCP connection active by not sending a FIN segment.
    - By using session cookies.
    - >-
      After the connection is closed, reuse of ephemeral source port indicates
      that the connection was part of a previous session.
    - Creating a pseudo random session ID and passing it as part of the URL.
    - HTTP doesn't support stateful connections, so HTTPS must be used.

    You are attempting to use wget to recusively download a website that has a
    directory structure that is maximum five levels deep. When you run the
    command you aren't getting but a couple files back. What could be the issue?
  choices:
    - >-
      Specify the "-l 5" paramater to retrieve five levels deep as wget supports
      three levels by default.
    - >-
      Force wget to use HTTPS by specifying the parameter "--https-only" as the
      site is HTTPS only and when wget receives a 301 "moved permanently"
      redirect message, wget is unable to switch to HTTPS.
    - >-
      Use the "-6" option to use IPv6 as the site is listening only to IPv6 and
      wget is unable to understand the IPv4 to IPv6 redirect message.
