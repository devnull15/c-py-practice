    In the process of transmission, a packet makes it to the router directly
    connected to the destination host. The router performs an ARP broadcast
    requesting the MAC address of the destination host, but doesn't get a
    response. What would be the ICMP type of the response in number form?

    A ping packet is traversing the network on its way to the destination. It
    reaches a router that has no knowledge of the destination network. What
    would the router do?
  choices:
    - Respond with an ICMP type 3, Code 0
    - Respond with an ICMP type 3, Code 1
    - Respond with an ICMP type 3, Code 2
    - Respond with an ICMP type 3, Code 3
    - The router will send no response
