  text: With respect to DNS, what is TTL?
  choices:
    - >-
      TTL is Time to Live and it is the number of hops a packet can traverse.
      When the TTL reaches zero, the packet is dropped.
    - >-
      TTL is a layer 3 concept and DNS operates at layer 7 so therefore there is
      no TTL (Time to Live).
    - >-
      TTL is Time to Live and with DNS it is the amount of time before the DNS
      records become stale and a zone transfer is required.
    - >-
      TTL is Time to Live and with DNS it is the amount of time a client that
      receives the DNS information should cache that information. The TTL is set
      in the Start of Authority (SOA) record and all domain records inherit the
      TTL from it. In order to change the TTL, the SOA record must be edited.

    You are checking your logs and seen attempted connections from an IP
    address. What can you do to find out what fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
    this may resolve to?
  choices:
    - DNS is a one way resolver, that is it only resolves FQDN's to IPs.
    - >-
      Use the command "dig -x AA.BB.CC.DD" where AA.BB.CC.DD is the IP address
      of the system you are querying.
    - >-
      Use the command "nslookup -type=PTR AA.BB.CC.DD.in-addr.arp" where
      AA.BB.CC.DD is the IP address of the system you are querying.
    - >-
      Use the command "nslookup -type=PTR DD.CC.BB.AA.in-addr.arp" where
      DD.CC.BB.AA is the IP address in reverse order of the system you are
      querying.

  choices:
    - The first one in the list as it traverses the list from top down.
    - >-
      It can't be determined from this output as the MX records are handled in a
      round-robin fashion and the server will pick the next mail server in the
      list.
    - The server with the lowest priority number will be used.
    - The server with the highest priority number will be used.

    A hosts sends a query requesting the address for a fully qualified domain
    name (FQDN). The transaction ID is 23922? What will be the transaction ID
    response to this requiest?
  choices:
    - >-
      The response transaction ID will be the same as the request transaction
      ID.
    - >-
      Transaction IDs are incremented by both the client and DNS server for each
      request and response so they can determine if DNS is out of sync since a
      transaction ID will be missing due to a dropped datagram.
    - >-
      The response transaction ID will be pseudo-randomly generated in the
      response so that can be uniquely tracked.
    - The response transaction ID will be the request transaction ID + 1.

    - The MAC address of the queried DNS server.
    - The transaction ID in the query.

    A hosts primary DNS server is configured to perform iterative queries. A
    host asks its primary DNS server for the IP address of a fully qualified
    domain name (FQDN). The primary DNS server does not have the answer to that
    query. Considering typical DNS configuration and operation which system will
    perform the query that provides the answer for the host?
  choices:
    - Primary DNS server
    - Secondary DNS server
    - Upstream Caching Server
    - Root DNS Server
    - The Authoritative DNS Server
    - The host that performed the query
