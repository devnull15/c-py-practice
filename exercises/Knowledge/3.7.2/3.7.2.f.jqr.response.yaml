    What are the MAC addresses of a DHCP Request message and the reason they are
    set this way?
  choices:
    - >-
      Source MAC FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF, destination MAC
      FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF. Since DHCP is a broadcast oriented
      protocol, broadcast MAC addresses are used.
    - >-
      Source MAC is the MAC address assigned to the NIC of the client,
      destination MAC is the MAC address of the DHCP server. Because both
      devices have learned each others MAC address from the DHCP Request and
      Offer, then unicast MAC addresses can be used.
    - >-
      Source MAC is the MAC address assigned to the NIC of the client,
      destination MAC FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF. Broadcasts are
      typically only required when the MAC address of the destination is
      unknown, but in this case the client does have the MAC address of the DHCP
      server learned via the DHCP offer message, but since it is possible that
      multiple DHCP servers provided an offer, the destination MAC is set as 
      broadcast so that other DHCP servers are notified that the client didn't
      accept their offer.
    - >-
      Source MAC FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF, destination MAC is the
      MAC address of the DHCP server. Since DHCP is a broadcast oriented
      protocol, the client uses the broadcast MAC addresses and since it has
      learned the MAC address of the server from the DHCP Offer, then it can
      send the DHCP Request via unicast.
    - >-
      Source MAC FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF&#58;FF, destination MAC is the
      MAC address of the default gatewary/router. Since DHCP is a broadcast
      oriented protocol, the client uses a broadcast MAC addresses, but since it
      is likely that the server is not on the local network segment, the default
      gateway/router is used to tranfer the DHCP Request message.

    You know that the DHCP address you typically get is 172.16.2.19/16. Today,
    you power on your computer and the address you receive is 169.254.3.22/16. 
    Why is this?
  choices:
    - >-
      Your previous address was  flushed from the DHCP pool and you received
      another address that is part of the same network.
    - >-
      Another client likely received your address since it wasn't in use due to
      you having the computer turned on, so the server assigned another address
      in the same pool.
    - >-
      The lease on the address you had expired and in the process of requesting
      a new lease, the DHCP server gave you a different address.
    - The DHCP server has crashed.
    - >-
      Your DHCP server is on a different segment and the relay agent was
      unresponsive.
