    An IPv6 packet protocol field contains the number 17 (0x11). What does this
    mean?
  choices:
    - This packet can propagate trough 17 more routers before it is dropped.
    - This packet can propagate trough 16 more routers before it is dropped.
    - This packet is the seventeenth in the series of multiple packets.
    - This packet is carrying a TCP segment which is using the quote protcol.

  text: What are some attributes of IPv6?
  choices:
    - >-
      The source and destination addresses are 128 bit or less if compression is
      used.
    - The source and destination addresses are 128 bit.
    - The IPv6 header has fewer fields than an IPv4 header.
    - The IPv6 header is longer than an IPv4 header.
    - IPv6 does not support fragmentation.
    - >-
      IPv6 eliminated the need of the funtionality provided by Time to Live
      (TTL).
    - IPv6 does not use broadcasts.
    - >-
      A system that utilizes IPv6 will likely have more than one IPv6 address
      assigned to it.
    - >-
      When setting up a system you must decided whether to use IPv4 or IPv6 as
      they are mutually exclusive.

    You are configuring the IPv6 rules on your host based firewalls and set it
    up to only allow packets that match the addresses you have assigned to your
    systems, but your systems have lost complete connectivity to each other.
    What would cause this?
  choices:
    - >-
      You must also configure matching rules for IPv4 as IPv6 relies on IPv4
      connectivity.
    - You fat fingered the configuration on all your systems.
    - >-
      The addresses you assigned are likely global addresses. Link-local address
      are typically auto-generated and are the addresses typically used for
      neighbor communication. You will have to adjust your rules to include
      these.
    - >-
      You must configure the host firewalls to allow the broadcast addresses
      that are needed to perform Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
