  choices:
    - >-
      separate processor caches for the instructions and data, with separate
      pathways into the processor for each

      the word width, timing, implementation technology, and memory address
      structure can differ from the instruction memory
    - data operation and an ALU operation cannot occur simultaneously
    - Crystal frequency is a limiting factor on ALU operations

    The Harvard architecture term originated from the Harvard Mark I relay-based
    computer, which stored instructions on punched tape (24 bits wide) and data
    in electro-mechanical counters.
