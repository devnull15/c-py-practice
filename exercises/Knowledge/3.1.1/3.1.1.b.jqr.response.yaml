  text: What is NOT a reason that we return 0?
  choices:
    - It is required to return an int value in an int main()
    - >-
      It is good programming practice to return 0 to mark a successful
      completion
    - It allows outside sources to know that the program completed successfully
    - It is required to specifically return a 0 to mark a successful completion
