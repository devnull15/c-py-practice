    You are creating a program that will communicate with another process.
    Although you can use AF_INET, you decide to use AF_UNIX? What are the
    advanates/limitations?
  choices:
    - >-
      By using AF_UNIX, then the communicating processes must be on the same
      host.
    - >-
      By using AF_UNIX, then the communicating processes can be on different
      hosts providing full client/server communications.
    - You are losing portability as Windows doesn't support this.
    - Sockets created with AF_UNIX are faster than those created with AF_INET.
    - Sockets created with AF_UNIX are always connectionless
    - Sockets created with AF_UNIX do not use TCP or UDP ports.
    - >-
      Sockets created with AF_UNIX are RAW sockets and it is up to the
      programmer to write the protocol stack.
