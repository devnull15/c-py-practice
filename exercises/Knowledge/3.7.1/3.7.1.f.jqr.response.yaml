    RFC 5952 covers address compression and representation for IPv6 addresses.
    What is the purpose of the ommission of leading zeros and zero compression?
  choices:
    - >-
      Zero ommission and compression can reduce the size of a 128 bit address to
      a much smaller address which takes less space in the IPv6 header, thus
      reducing overhead.
    - >-
      Zero ommission and compression reduces the written size of an IPv6
      address, but the address remains 128 bit.
    - Zero ommission and compression cannot be used at the same time.
    - Zero ommission can be used only in conjunction with zero compression.
