  text: Which of the following is a valid reason to subnet a network?
  choices:
    - Increase the amount of available IP addresses.
    - Reduce the amount of available IP addresses.
    - >-
      Create additional networks so that each may be delegated for further
      subnetting or management by a network administrator.
    - Increase the size of the broadcast domain.

    Which of the following is a valid reason to subnet a network with respect to
    security?
  choices:
    - >-
      It is easier and more effective to apply, manage, and monitor security to
      a subnet than it is to indidual addresses.
    - You can only apply a security policy to a subnet.
    - >-
      If your organization is comprised of multiple systems (i.e.
      Windows/Linux/Mac), subnets must be created for each type of system as
      security to a subnet must be uniform.
    - Subnets are synonymous with security domains.

  text: What is the impact of subnetting on broadcasts?
  choices:
    - >-
      If the size of the subnet is larger than the amount of devices in that
      subnet, then broadcasts are eliminated increasing the performance of the
      network.
    - >-
      If the size of the subnet is smaller than the amount of devices in that
      subnet, then broadcasts are eliminated increasing the performance of the
      network.
    - >-
      Subnetting reduces the size of a network ensures fewer devices per network
      which isolates the impact of a broadcast frame to that subnet.
    - >-
      Subnetting has no effect on broadcasts as broadcasts are still sent to all
      devices in the original network that was subnetted.

  text: What is the impact of subnetting on congestion?
  choices:
    - >-
      As long as a device is communicating via unicast with a device in other
      subnet, then only those two devices are impacted.
    - >-
      Because communcation between device would take place whether they are on
      the same or different subnets, then congestion is not impacted.
    - >-
      Because a layer 3 device such as a router is required to allow two subnets
      to communicate, congestion is reduced as layer 3 devices are required to
      reduce congestion.
    - >-
      As long as the communicating devices are in the same subnet, then only the
      devices in that subnet are impacted.
