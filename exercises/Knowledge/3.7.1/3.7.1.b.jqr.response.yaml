  text: Which of the following potentially makes UDP faster than TCP?
  choices:
    - >-
      The bit rate for UDP is increased as UDP acknowledgements are not
      required.
    - The UDP header is smaller than the TCP header so there is less overhead.
    - >-
      UDP datagrams can be sent one after another immediately without having to
      wait as it has no capacity for reliable communications.
    - >-
      TCP and UDP use the same header, but the flags are ignored so the "three
      way handshake" is bypassed and acknowledgements are disabled.
