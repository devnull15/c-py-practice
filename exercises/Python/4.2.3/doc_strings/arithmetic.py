3.2.3
title: demonstrate the ability to perform basic arithmetic operations while
       ensuring proper order of operations (PEMDAS)

sub_items:
    a - Addition(+)
    b - Subtraction(-)
    c - Multiplication(*)
    d - Division(/)
    e - Modulus(%)

Brief: Add function parameters and your own implementation to complete
       the functions. Test your solution against the tests suite using
       "from tests import run_tests; run_tests()"
