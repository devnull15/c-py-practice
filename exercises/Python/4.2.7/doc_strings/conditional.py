title: demonstrate skill in creating and implementing conditional
statements, expressions and contructs
condition: C
standard: C
sub_items:
    a - for loop
    b - while loop
    c - if statement
    d - if->else statement
    e - if->elif->else statement

Brief: Add function parameters and your own implementation to complete
       the functions. Test your solution against the tester.py file.
